# team-meet

Team-Meet was a senior project I made for team members to collaborate on projects online when face to face is not possible.

Users can create an account and login to our system. Once logged in a user can create a project where he or she has access to 
a chat window, private messaging, a place to upload images and more.

Technology: HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP and MySQL
